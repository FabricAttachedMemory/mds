demo3-multithread

This demo supports running multiple instances with different heaps, for each instance 
you need to first create a new sub-directory, for example:

# mkdir demo
# cd demo

Once inside the directory use the following scripts to populate an execute a demo instance

demo scripts:

createheap
- uses its own version of createheap, rather than the common one, 
  to create larger heaps for this demo3 specifically

setup-run
- uses its own version of setup-run, rather than the common one, 
  to add to the path libs specific to demo3 including RabbitMQ 



rundemo3init            
- creates store and populates it with an inventory (with gaps in product naming)

rundemo3shop1  
rundemo3shop2
rundemo3shop3
- run these three processes in parallel to generate tasks working on inventory



useful scripts:

rundemo3shop   
- test run shop with default parameters

rundemo3shopbias
- test run shop with bias set true - all tasks work on product P00001

runmdsuser3
- run to generate report on current contents of inventory in store
