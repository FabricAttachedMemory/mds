/**
 * A variant of {@link Iteration} in which elements of the base {@link Iterable} are subject to a {@link Transformer} to 
 * obtain their final value and in which {@link #base()} returns elements of the actual type of the base Iterable.
 * Instances are typically constructed 
 * by calling {@link Iteration#overBased(Iterable, Transformer)} or {@link Iteration#overBased(Object[], Transformer)}.
 * See documentation for {@link Iteration} for details.  
 * 
 * @param <X> The type of the base {@link Iterable} (i.e., {@link #baseCurrent()}).
 * @param <T> The type of the result of calling the {@link Transformer} on elements of the base Iterable (i.e., {@link #current()}).
 * @param <C> The type of the base Iterable (i.e., {@link #base()}.
